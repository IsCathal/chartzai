17i2fhi,Are you guys worried that AI will take your job?,k6u9vlg,Graham76782,1,"My biggest concern with AI is that I will lose access to it in a meaningful way. Right now I am using it as a personal tutor to learn new skills to further my career, and to drive it towards a more desirable direction, 100% WFH remote location independent work and relevant skills only. But I am relying on paid ChatGPT, which is very restrictive in terms of it's token short term memory, ability to debate and argue, ability to standby the facts and not be a pushover that accepts misinformation, and also I think its ethical and safety protections are very misguided and poorly implemented.

I'm very concerned that AI will turn into an arms race in regards to skills, and those with the best personal AI tutors will always out perform those that don't have that asset. This is why I feel forced to pay for ChatGPT. In regard to it taking my job, I'm not really concerned about that, but I am very concerned about it obsoleting my field, network engineering, so I'm trying to pivot my set of skills.

I think if you want job security then learning AI is a good bet. I think of it like working with horses right at the time of Henry Ford and the model T. Probably not a bad job to work with horses right at that time, but very soon after you're going to be out of luck if you haven't pivoted your set of skills and career tragectory.

It might create more efficiency, which means that the same work can be done with fewer people. But it won’t wipe away the necessity for human employees in these industries.

AI is just responding to prompts from humans. And its output often requires review and further prompts to get the correct response or review and manual cleanup done by a person before it’s actually useful.

There are also tasks that AI handles well and tasks it doesn’t. So it might save time in the idea generation phase of say, writing a script for a video, giving you a dozen great ideas and titles in an instant, but it might take you 3x as long to proof it if you have AI write the script because it’s going to take longer for an editor to review it, fact check it, and correct any errors.

There will be some parts of the work that it creates efficiencies in and some parts where it will still be more efficient to just have a skilled human do it.

So, it will become a tool to make workers more efficient, not a robot worker that fully replaces the need to employ you.

You are in serious denial about AI. Anything that can be done on a computer can be done by an AI and once those jobs are gone there isn’t a “new technology” replacement jobs waiting in the wings. Big tech has been trying to tell you this yet a lot of people have their heads in the sand. It may not happen today or tomorrow but the rate of change can only increase as AI gets better and labor costs have always been an issue for employers even if automating their business to reduce costs ends up in fact destabilizing society because there will be no consumers other then other automated companies.

Which jobs will be in demand? Which ones are shrinking? And which ones could be hardest to fill?


During the pandemic (2019–22), the US labor market saw 8.6 million occupational shifts, 50 percent more than in the previous three-year period. Most involved people leaving food services, in-person sales, and office support for different occupations.

>By 2030, activities that account for up to 30 percent of hours currently worked across the US economy could be automated—a trend accelerated by generative AI. However, we see generative AI enhancing the way STEM, creative, and business and legal professionals work rather than eliminating a significant number of jobs outright. Automation’s biggest effects are likely to hit other job categories. Office support, customer service, and food service employment could continue to decline.
Federal investment to address climate and infrastructure, as well as structural shifts, will also alter labor demand. The net-zero transition will shift employment away from oil, gas, and automotive manufacturing and into green industries for a modest net gain in employment. Infrastructure projects will increase demand in construction, which is already short almost 400,000 workers today. We also see increased demand for healthcare workers as the population ages, plus gains in transportation services due to e-commerce.

>An additional 12 million occupational transitions may be needed by 2030. As people leave shrinking occupations, the economy could reweight toward higher-wage jobs. Workers in lower-wage jobs are up to 14 times more likely to need to change occupations than those in highest-wage positions, and most will need additional skills to do so successfully. Women are 1.5 times more likely to need to move into new occupations than men.

>The United States will need workforce development on a far larger scale as well as more expansive hiring approaches from employers. Employers will need to hire for skills and competencies rather than credentials, recruit from overlooked populations (such as rural workers and people with disabilities), and deliver training that keeps pace with their evolving needs.",1698467364,0.14835227272727272,Positive,"['“ new technology ” replacement jobs waiting', 'additional 12 million occupational transitions may', 'economy could reweight toward higher', 'new technology would take away', 'us labor market saw 8', 'involved people leaving food services', 'food service employment could continue', '6 million occupational shifts', 'hours currently worked across', 'handsome cabs never thought', 'already short almost 400', '02 https :// seo', '2019 – 22 ),', 'also see increased demand', 'things https :// www', '20year https :// tech', 'also alter labor demand', 'legal professionals work rather', 'see generative ai enhancing', 'us economy could', 'people leave shrinking occupations', 'https :// www', 'https :// www', 'transportation services due', 'shift employment away', 'statistics #:~: text', 'far larger scale', 'fact destabilizing society', 'expansive hiring approaches', 'reduce costs ends', 'need additional skills', 'work trip without', 'modest net gain', 'need workforce development', 'ai gets better', '000 workers today', 'new occupations', 'technology changed', 'labor costs', 'customer service', 'ones could', 'structural shifts', 'disabilities ),', 'competencies rather', 'big tech', 'happen today', 'different occupations', 'increase demand', 'zero transition', 'year period', 'way stem', 'wage positions', 'united states', 'trend accelerated', 'travel agent', 'travel agencies', 'think tank', 'store fronts', 'significant number', 'serious denial', 'rural workers', 'replacement', 'probably unaware', 'previous three', 'population ages', 'plus gains', 'person sales', 'owned stables', 'overlooked populations', 'office support', 'office support', 'modern sense', 'maybe even', 'keeps pace', 'job categories', 'internet era', 'industrial revolution', 'healthcare workers', 'green industries', 'federal investment', 'evolving needs', 'even businesses', 'door knockers', 'deliver training', 'change occupations', 'biggest effects', 'automotive manufacturing', 'automated —', 'automated companies', 'address climate', '50 percent', '5 times', '30 percent', '14 times', 'generative ai', 'wage jobs', 'wage jobs', 'jobs outright', 'technology', 'may', 'infrastructure projects', 'actual jobs', 'employers even', 'automation ’', 'labor', 'employment', 'demand', 'shrinking', 'generative', 'work', 'work', 'people', 'people', 'people', 'people', 'workers', 'skills', 'net', 'jobs', 'jobs', 'jobs', 'jobs', 'jobs', 'jobs', 'need', 'need', 'need', 'ai', 'ai', 'ai', 'ai', 'ai', 'ai', 'ai', 'ones', 'infrastructure', 'increase', 'change', 'actual', 'employers', 'employers', '’', '’', '’', 'yet', 'yes', 'yes', 'women', 'wiped', 'wings', 'well', 'well', 'vacation', 'used', 'trying', 'trillion', 'trends', 'took', 'tomorrow', 'thinkautomation', 'tell', 'successfully', 'sand', 'roles', 'risk', 'research', 'replacing', 'replace', 'recruit', 'rate', 'predicts', 'pandemic', 'oil', 'news', 'needed', 'move', 'miilions', 'mgi', 'men', 'mckinsey', 'lower', 'lots', 'lot', 'lost', 'likely', 'likely', 'likely', 'kinds', 'issue', 'intelligence', 'imagine', 'however', 'horses', 'hit', 'hire', 'highest', 'heads', 'hardest', 'gone', 'generations', 'gas', 'future', 'future', 'fill', 'eliminating', 'e', 'done', 'done', 'decline', 'credentials', 'creative', 'consumers', 'construction', 'computer', 'commerce', 'com', 'com', 'com', 'co', 'chatgpt', 'careers', 'career', 'businessinsider', 'business', 'business', 'blog', 'beginning', 'automating', 'artificial', 'arrange', 'anything', 'america', 'always', 'activities', 'account', '20the', '20same', '20of', '20impact', '20by', '20ai', '2030', '2030', '2023', '10', '1']",True,1

19ebmm1,Is anyone concerned about the impact AI might have to your job?,kjbo55a,PolarPeely26,15,"I'm a Chartered Surveyor.

In the last six months, our company has signed up to an AI product that has automated our report writing.

We used to write reports along with a support staff. Now, an AI program does it, and we check it. 

This has reduced our time to do the report by nearly 85%, but the amount of new work has not increased at all. So we have highly qualified staff doing different things like networking and trying to win more work. It is already pushing down the sum quoted as Surveyors are very keen to win work as they have more time available.

The AI will only improve, and it shall improve fast, and I'd guess in a year or so we won't need to check reports as much, and we'll be wiser and using AI for many more tasks and jobs.

Over winter, our board (that I am not a member of) had a seminar on AI, and one of the key points was the ability to reduce man-hours spent on a job.

Staff and the leadership are generally excited and celebrating the AI.

But I suspect they won't be employing as many new people and shall ultimately lead to some or many redundancies.

But I don't think it will stop there. 

If AI can write the reports, eventually, I suspect our clients won't need us as they'll go to the AI for the report rather than us further down the line.

We are also automating lots of jobs support staff did just a few months ago. Both by policy and just by naturally as AI becomes part of our go-to software.

A simple example...

Yesterday, I needed a large amount of text extracted from images so I could then copy and paste the text (words) into an email. A few months ago, I'd have asked our support staff team to do that, and it would have taken an hour or so, and a day lead in waiting time as they would have been doing other jobs first. Well, I got Google Bard AI to do that for me, and it saved hours of work and gave me a perfect reply in 5 seconds.

My belief is that this will crush a lot of professional jobs over the next 5 to 10 years.

Anyone who thinks their role and industry will be unaffected needs a reality check, and I feel it is either ignorant to what AI is and will soon be doing, or they may just be arrogant.

19ebmm1,Is anyone concerned about the impact AI might have to your job?,kjbpcw2,,6,"It's a big debate in my sector, museums. On the one hand, we do a lot of copywriting and research that could be automated - on the other hand, we're paid by the taxpayer to maintain a pool of experts to act as a publicly-available authority on their subject matter. So they can't be automated, because the whole point is they can give a more nuanced answer than any book or research paper (because they wrote the book.)


What we will see is things like digitisation of historical documents, registration of acquisitions, object description writing, and some research assistant work becoming automated. It'll be slow, a good few years behind the trend (because museums are, by their very nature, wary of change.)


I'm not overly worried about jobs being lost. We had a cross-organisation panel investigate what jobs could be automated and found that most of the work that can be won't impact employment numbers. 


For example, we currently have a collection of prints that need descriptions writing. We estimate it will take around 1000 hours for a research assistant to write them, or 70 with an AI assistant. We can't lay off any research assistants though, because we only have two and their current backlog of item descriptions would take over three hundred years to process at current rate. 


Ultimately, we'll automate jobs (once the powers that be come around to it. They will.) But it will be jobs that were so understaffed there won't be anyone to lay off.

It won't. The way that all AI works is regurgitation. It's mathematical, mostly based on things like Bayes. You train a model with categorisation and then it ""learns"" from that. Like number plate recognition is about giving AI thousands of variations of each character from photographs and then when you give it another photograph it does various bits of image manipulation and then gives a weight to which character it most likely is. 

Most of the text in ChatGPT seems smart, but it's just doing the same thing but with words. It doesn't understand what it's doing. It's just following words with other words based on probability. It doesn't have context and might never have context because it's all about math.  And to some extent, human beings are Bayesian. 90% of your friends tell you Nando's is good, 10% tell you it's shit, you probably go to Nando's. But you also might ask why that guy tells you it's shit and you understand the context of their complaints and actually, his complaint might mean that you choose not to go to Nando's.

It's why I think most of what's happening now is a lot of hype.

""AI"" is an overloaded term, so conversations around it become difficult. Scripted automation has been with us for decades and we used it to increase productivity adapt into more interesting careers.

Large language models are really only a minor step forward. They take ""grunt work"" out of our day and allow us to focus on the areas where we add value. After all, GPT can't really learn anything new. Yes, some ""grunts"" will need to upskill, the same way people have adapted in the past.

Resources/labour would be abundant but humans, being the competitive little creatures that we are, not happy with equality, would likely invent outlets for that. We're doing it now with YouTube followers, online gaming, sports etc.

We don't HAVE to automate things. AI has ""solved"" chess, but people are still playing it for the pure human experience of it. Others even make a career out of it.

If we only need to do 20% of the collective work, we can spend the other 80% of our time on more interesting pursuits. AI doesn't care for sailing across the world, but humans do. It's certainly much more rewarding than driving a spreadsheet all day.

Tech companies are making bets on AI helping them trim the fat they built, they haven’t deployed it fully to cover that yet. But they will.

Biggest threat this year are layoffs becoming the fashion beyond tech, and dipshit CEOs feeling pressured to layoff and cite AI as a reason.

That pressure will get terrible over the next 2-3 years as markets simply expect businesses to have realized the actual value that AI has in any given industry and role type.

All in, Amazon is probably a primary company to watch to get a sense for how it will waterfall in.  Whatever Amazon does will serve as a template for many businesses.

This was from a nice study done last year by some guys watching freelance employment sites and wages.  This is keyed to the release of gpt 3.5.

Working with a customer who spends $350 just to get a blog post created from writers they keep on retainer.

I uploaded their style guide and built an agent, showed them how to tune things a bit…that 350 went to $1.33.

*edited: I can almost guarantee businesses who do not have a defined AI strategy will get hammered in the markets starting sooner than later.  This is 15-65 percent productivity CEOs are leaving on the table every day, even with gpt 4 and no more.

There's a concept in economics called inelasticity. In essence, small percentage changes in availability result in massive price swings. If the oil supply goes down 2 percent, prices can double. It works this way too with labor, but mostly against workers, almost never for them, because of course the slugmen control the politics of the labor market and can prevent substantial wage spikes by simply waiting them out. Plus, an ""inelasticity event"" in one job market can spread to others.

GPT is perhaps the most obvious expression of ML but it's hardly the first. We humans have been busily building a lot of automated tools. For the most part those tools have needed people to run/manage/guide them but that last bit is also now beginning to be automated.

You used to need a very highly paid analyst to put your data together in the right way to run sophisticated analysis on it. You still do but the day that's no longer the case doesn't look too far off. If the hallucination problem is solved and the degradation over multiple steps problem is resolved then it's going to be a quite robust AGI.

GPT can already use all kinds of programming tools, create documents, etc. It won't do much outside of its sandbox, yet. It's not going to drop a table for you, for example. But that day does not seem distant...if it takes 5 years I'd be surprised it took that long.

1afv431,Is AI causing a massive wave of unemployment now?,kocww4b,Dractheridon,16,"The issue is Wall Street looks at tech as if their only value is in perpetual, constant growth. No company can guarantee that, so when they hit a plateau of growth, they look to things that can simulate growth.

This is usually in the form of layoffs and cost cutting, which, up until recently Wall Street frowned upon. The idea was layoffs were considered bad for business.

However, sometime in '22 Wall Street and ""arm chair investors"" started to be fed all these stories about AI being good, that it could replace jobs. They started looking into the tech.

Tech companies and other businesses are lead by CEOs - furious of unionizing, or in tech, workers refusal to return to the office environment - largely ignoring the research that shows an actual increase in productivity. They heard terms like ""quiet quitting"", and, looking at their empty offices - offices that once gave their egos huge enrichment ( no doubt  stroked by their phallic monuments that scraped the skies ) - now were empty, now were missing the people they would lord over, no longer seeing the masses that attended their mandatory all-hands meetings (that nobody really cared about)

It was about the economics of real estate - those businesses were in areas largely impacted by  growing real-estate, cost of child care, and a growing realization that the office environment actually hindered you from getting work done.

Angry, and desiring some sort of power play, these leaders started forcing the issue with harsh, unfair Return To Office (RTO) mandates, quietly seeking ways to get employees they didn't like to quit, because firings en-masse ""looked bad"".

Fast forward and you saw Alphabet, Meta, etc - start to layoff people under the excuse of ""over-hiring during COVID"" - which was code for ""we don't know what to do with them, because our growth is flat"".

Jobs were cut severely, yet, this time, the market didn't punish them, as they feared. Instead the market bounced up.

Today, they are attacking their workers again, still frustrated by the workers essentially standing their ground, telling them ""no"".

They claim it's AI (content generation, automation) that is removing the jobs.

Make no mistake - it is not - these companies are posting record profits.

They put up AI as their excuse to exact revenge for leaving their offices and their egos in the dirt in favor of actual productivity - this can only go so far before it, too runs out of runway.

Meanwhile, AI didn't make thing easier, workers just have to do more work - sometimes, twice or three times the work they used to, as their co-workers get laid off. Bad decisions from management, that lead to decline in growth, are not reflected back on the managers. Instead the workers are made to further suffer.

Expect more companies to merger or to shut down. AI isn't a game changer as they said. It's already hitting its limits. But the angry ego-driven (mostly male) CEOs - that are largely compensated at insane levels ( eg Elon Musk asking for a 55B dollar payday ) - they still want their money and provide almost zero value.

This is all moving towards greater wealth inequality, both in personal wealth ( Musk ) and in corporate wealth ( Alphabet/Google ) - it's why we should tax the rich, and break up the Big Tech companies ( similar to AT&Ts breakup )

I hope we can see some legislation soon, protecting workers from the hostile work environment.

1afv431,Is AI causing a massive wave of unemployment now?,kodtgdz,gpt872323,1,"It is mostly the people who are not adapting to the new age.

If you are going to complain about AI you cannot help. It was something like the Industrial Revolution. People survived and adapted maybe the previous generation who are aged will get more impact but it will subside.

Being motivated by statements of Elon, or another AI is evil you have to realize they are not fully meritocratic and rather prioritizing their ventures to succeed in competition.

Yes, there is the danger of AI but that is more on state level rather individual for e.g AI drone, etc you create a monster killing people without having any emotional attachment. For e.g now if a soldier or someone presses that trigger there is still a lot of thinking that happens versus drones and tanks killing left and right. As the country that is using the tech will not be getting casualties they can become too disconnected from humans.

Also, the information is not going to be up to date in the current way and it just feels slow to research something like an error or something. Yes, AI can be useful for getting quick answers, content, and code. Where I am not able to search the web you use. Up till now I still use google and no bing/bard hasn't replaced it. Many of the searches are open-ended rather than a simple answer.

Where AI stands out is when I was not able to search documentation/examples of a setting for a framework I did not know what to write with a combination of those settings. The chatbot was able to answer for me to set in the direction of to experiment. This saved me hours. If I am just looking to search github for an error on a recent update the chatbot will not be helpful.

There are 2 ways to think and recently I was working with creative professionals in writing my observations.

1. Using AI to their benefit producing a lot more content and much of it vs previously they were able to do 1 article a day now can do 4 articles a day with references. Also using dall-e/stable-diffusion for images to go with it. They are happy with this innovation as the pressure to be creative on demand is now over as they get some sort of initial start they can refine.

[According to a study by PwC, only 1% of jobs will disappear due to automation, which includes AI as a subset ](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/08/ai-chatgpt-jobs-economy-inequality)[^(2)](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2018/02/14/why-the-real-ai-jobs-issue-isnt-unemployment/). However, it is important to note that the impact of AI on employment is not uniform across all industries and job types. [For instance, white-collar jobs such as office-based work, customer service, and sales are more likely to be affected by AI than factory jobs ](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/08/ai-chatgpt-jobs-economy-inequality)[^(1)](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2023/feb/08/ai-chatgpt-jobs-economy-inequality).

1afv431,Is AI causing a massive wave of unemployment now?,koha55l,MacrosInHisSleep,1,"I think it's not true yet, the massive wave is yet to come. The bits and pieces of evidence are a bit more nuanced. 

Tech industry layoffs are only partially related to AI, but not it the way it's being suggested. Developers aren't being laid off because AI is doing their job. It's mainly then investor thing others have mentioned, but also the fact that some projects that are expected to land in a year or two will quite possibly require a different skillset because a new approach is now possible. Then there's the fact that some projects need to be axed because employers have a much bigger visions in mind, and you'd get lay off from that. 

This next one is my own speculation: There are also opportunists piggy backing off of this. During Covid there was a pretty high demand and tech folks were offered pretty high salaries. So I imagine they think it would be 'economical' to just lay folks off for other reasons and take advantage of a large 'supply' of tech folks to renegotiate salaries with? 

Then you've got the thing about writers, and I can see the low effort writers market which required taking news, condensing it and placing it on sites being easily replaced. That said I think that was already kind of happening before LLM's came around, just kind of with shittier tools.

Call centers are definitely letting people go. I personally know folks in the telecom industry who have told me they are handing out a lot of severance packages and letting people go. Again, we already had robocalls and automated answering machines eroding at this industry, so it's not surprising it's one of the first to go. 

Art in a bad place. Current artists still have the skills they've already learned, but are competing with folks who are generating AI art. They can technically use the same tools and have better results with the existing techniques they already use.

Given a few more years of sub-bar results in this current climate, Google will eventually be forgotten as well.

If you Bing something, the first thing you see is literal gpt, AI generated content, created in real time. If google were smart they'd be looking for sites exclusively based on content quality, regardless of if it's AI generated. If AI generated content was so poor of an experience to end users, bing wouldn't be in a current upward trajectory in terms of search engine market share like it is currently.

Google doesn't have to integrate an AI generator straight into search results like bing is doing, but rather they can look at ranking sites that use a good hybrid approach - AI generated content that has human oversight with good quality prompts, leading to helpful content. That would be better than what Bing does where there is no prompt currently, it's just raw AI.

For years Google has been on a moral crusade at the cost of its search results. I found it better back in 2012 pre-penguin update. Now it's an uphill battle to even get exact match results which before you could get via double quotes. Their results are increasingly generic, dumb and assume their users are idiots.
